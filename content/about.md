## Hi Rajkumar here,

I am currently working as a Software Engineer specifically in the back end.

I work on [Golang](https://go.dev/) majorly, I have professional
experience in JavaScript, [VueJS](https://vuejs.org/), 
[gRPC](https://grpc.io/), PostgreSQL, MySQL, Redis and MongoDB too.

Throughout my career, I've worked with two fintechs, an Ed-tech firm,
and a SaaS provider of data protection and management technologies.

In addition to these experiences, I have also done some freelancing and mentoring
which has enabled me to learn new things outside of my normal job duties.
