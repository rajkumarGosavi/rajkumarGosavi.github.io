Implications of developing a feature in a system
    Impact on the Product Team
    Impact on the Engineering
    Impact on the client/customer
Lifecycle of the feature
    Design
    Development
    Honeymoon
    Maintainence
    Deprecation
Is Product really a separate thing from engineering?

Questions to ask before even starting the product requirement.
Do We have high level clarity on the fundamental components of the system and how they function together?
Is the feature even needed?
Can there be any other alternative that can be implemented?
    processes, KT, information sharing
Who is the end user?

Questions to ask before LLD and implementation
Do we have clarity on the impacts (good and bad) that this new feature is going to have?
    No feature has only positive points
Does the vision of the Product team and the engineering team match?
    What is the product team solving for vs what is the engineering solving for (reduce over engineering)?
